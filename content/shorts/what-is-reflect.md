An attempt at a concise explanation of Goâ€™s `reflect` library.

The `reflect` package implements run-time reflection, allowing a program to check, amend and create arbitrary values of all kinds during implementation. Traditionally, Go is static, types are known and verified at compile time. The `reflect` package allows you to escape from this static world. It operates primarily on two concepts: `reflect.Type`, which represents the static properties of a type (like its name, methods, and struct fields), and `reflect.Value`, which holds the actual underlying data and allows for dynamic reading and writing.

You might want to use the `reflect` package if:
* You are writing code that must operate on types that are not known at compile time (e.g., a generic JSON marshaler, an object-relational mapper, or a dependency injection framework).
* You need to dynamically inspect the fields of a struct to implement generic validation logic.
* You are building powerful testing or mocking tools that need to instantiate or analyze arbitrary objects.

You might want to avoid or be very careful with the reflect package if:
* Performance is critical. Reflection-based operations are significantly slower than direct, statically-typed code.
* You value compile-time safety. Using reflect bypasses the static type checker; type errors will cause a run-time panic instead of a compile-time error.
* Code clarity is a priority. Code using reflection is often more complex and harder for other developers to understand and maintain.
* You believe you need it for a simple problem. There is often a simpler, type-safe solution using interfaces or code generation.
