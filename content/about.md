Hi,

I'm Francis, a Full Stack Engineer at [Talstack](https://talstack.com?ref=codehakase.com), where I build and maintain a fleet of tools powering Africa's workforce.

Previously at [Nala](https://nala.com?ref=codehakase.com), I contributed to the initial development and enhancement of the [Rafiki API](https://rafiki.com?ref=codehakase.com), building robust payment rails for remittances from Europe to Africa and integrating payout solutions across diverse African regions. I also developed and maintained critical internal tools, including a real-time transaction monitoring dashboard, playing a key role in the successful launch and scaling of their EU to Nigeria remittance service.

I care about building reliable systems. My work sits at the intersection of backend infrastructure, developer tools, and elegant functional design. I'm especially interested in distributed systems, databases, and functional programming, and I primarily work with Go and Haskell. 

Outside work, I spend time with my wonderful wife and kids, and I unwind at the piano. My favourite pieces include *Zadok the Priest, Water Music Suites Nos. 1-3, Kreutzer Violin Sonata, and How Excellent is Thy Loving Kindness*. 

You can find me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/codehakase.com?ref=codehakase.com) or [Twitter (X)](https://x.com/codehakase?ref=codehakase) as **@codehakase**, and my code lives on [Github](https://github.com/codehakase?ref=codehakase.com).
