Hi,

I'm Francis, and I'm currently a Full Stack engineer at [Talstack](https://talstack.com?ref=codehakase.com), where I work on and maintain a fleet of products powering Africa's workforce.

Previously at [Nala](https://nala.com?ref=codehakase.com), I contributed to the initial development and enhancement of the [Rafiki API](https://rafiki.com?ref=codehakase.com), building robust payment rails for remittances from Europe to Africa and integrating payout solutions across diverse African regions. I also developed and maintained critical internal tools, including a real-time transaction monitoring dashboard, playing a key role in the successful launch and scaling of their EU to Nigeria remittance service.

Some of my interests are distributed systems, databases, and functional programming, and I primarily work with Go and Haskell. 

When I'm not working, you'll find me spending quality time chilling with my lovely wife and kids. I also practice hymns and classical music on the piano, my favourites are *Zadok the Priest, Water Music Suites Nos. 1-3, Kreutzer Violin Sonata, and How Excellent is Thy Loving Kindness*. 

I'm on other platforms:
- BlueSky [@codehakase.com](https://bsky.app/profile/codehakase.com?ref=codehakase.com) or Twitter (X): [@codehakase](https://x.com/codehakase?ref=codehakase).
