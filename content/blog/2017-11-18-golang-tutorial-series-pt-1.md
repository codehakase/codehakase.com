> “Go will be the server language of the future.” — Tobias Lütke, Shopify

Go was first created as an experiment, the goal of its creators was to come up with a language that would resolve bad practices of others while keeping the good things.

Its first release was on March 2012. Go was designed to feel familiar and to stay as simple as possible, the entire language specification fits in just a few pages.

## What's this series about?
This series is a gentle introduction to the Go programing language, covering the basic concepts, syntax and features of Go. The ending parts of the series would focus on building from Zero to Live app using the Go programming language.

> Head over to the actual article on [The Practical Dev](https://dev.to/codehakase/golang---getting-started-16c) to continue on the series. I'll be posting the feeds here on my blog, when I drop a new part of this series on The Practical Dev.
